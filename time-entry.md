# Time Entry

Accurate, informative and timely* time entry is a crucial task*  for
successful project management. <u>**Clients will review every time entry**</u> we
record on their project, so it is essential to be thoughtful and professional in
your language.

We use [Harvest]( https://chrisrusso.harvestapp.com/welcome) to record time.

## How to write a _perfect_ time entry

- Pay close attention to the [appropriate task](#tasks) and log accordingly.
- Write an informative description. It may be concise but not empty.
  - Use professional language. Check your spelling.
- When applicable, reference the [project management](/redmine.html) issue number in your Harvest time entry. We have a [script that transfers time recorded in Harvest](https://github.com/savaslabs/sumac) to time spent on issues in our [project management tool](/redmine.html) which helps us monitor time estimated vs. time spent.

### Tasks

Tasks fall into two primary categories: **billable** and **non-billable**. Billable
tasks are those that are expected of us to invoice clients for based on our
agreed upon scope of work. Non-billable, naturally, we are not compensated for.
There are a set of "common" tasks that are added by default
([see exceptions](#exceptions)) to each client project and are the most commonly
used.

- **Admin** - non-billable catch-all for miscellaneous tasks; rarely used on client projects
- **Assessment/Estimating** - Estimating per a client's request.
- **Code Review** - PR review, other peer code analysis.
- **Design/UX** - Mockups, wireframes, UX tasks.
- **Development** - Writing code, configuring/building/writing software.
- **Project Management** - Client/internal calls/meetings, issue queue management, documentation, organizational tasks.
- **Research** - Sometimes you've got to look things up.
- **Setup/Deployment** - Local dev environment, staging or production deployments.
- **Research / Strategy / Consulting** - Researching a technical solution, advising a client, consulting on options and approaches. Discovery tasks.
- **Testing** - Writing automated tests, manual QA
- **Theme development** - Building templates, writing SASS/LESS/CSS.
- **Unestimated / Out of Scope** - Tasks that become part of a project that were not in the initial scope of work. These tasks can be driven clients with new requests or by developers taking a new approach.

### Internal projects and tasks

Internal projects help us track how we're investing our time internally, and
although they have overlap in tasks with a typical client project, they have
unique tasks attributed to them. Ensure to select the appropriate internal
project for each internal task as there are multiple. As always, ask when you
don't know.

- Admin = catch all, please be more specific when possible. Checking email, daily-standup.
- Blog writing / research / review - Blog writing or reading/reviewing of others'.
- Business Development - Reading a proposal, providing estimates for a proposal, conversing about a prospective project.
- Training - Personal skill development
- Meeting - Internal calls or in-person meetings
- Skillshare - Team skillshare, time researching / preparing for skillshare delivery
- Mentoring - Providing training to a teammate

#### Exceptions

Sometimes it will be necessary to tie projects to very specific tasks within a
given scope of work to facilitate accurate reporting and ensure maintenance of
budget. When this is the case, the project manager/lead will inform each team
member and the appropriate tasks to select for the project will be clearly
stated on the project wiki page.
